        <p>I just finished my first IELTS speaking test the other day. I haven’t taken the speaking test before, so I was very nervous before the test. And the first time the oral test is more British, I am not familiar with their communication style, which makes me more nervous.<br> Before the exam, I practiced every oral topic with my teacher repeatedly. At the beginning, I talked very sluggishly and I didn’t have any ideas yet. So I wrote down the topic for which I had no idea. Although some content is still not enough, with the help of the teacher, I added a lot of new content. Finally, after repeated practice, my spoken English became much fluent.<br> Although I practiced many times before the exam, I felt that I was fully prepared, and I was still very nervous on the day of the exam. My parents saw my nervousness at the time, and they repeatedly encouraged me. With their encouragement, my tension gradually weakened. When I arrived at the exam waiting hall, I read the spoken topic several times and spoke in a low voice. Approaching the exam, I repeatedly calmed my mood.<br> During the exam, I felt that I was more fluent and confident than usual practice. Through this incident, I understand that when facing something unfamiliar to me, I must be fully prepared before this. Only when you are fully prepared can you be more confident.</p>

        <p><strong>Because I’m a student in China ,I must undertake nine years of compulsory education .At the end of this education ,every student must take a final test the senior high school entrance examination, we also call it ‘Middle examination’. Just as its name implies ,it is an important basis for deciding which senior school students can go to, it can be even be said it is only basis. So the result of this was very important to me and could be regarded as my greatest academic achievement since I was born. The result of the examination not only the basis for selection of senior school, but also a summery of my nine years of compulsory education. Before the final exam, we have a little middle exam in the end of the second semester of junior two, it is included in the final exam, we must pass it in order to take the final exam. Luckily , it was not very hard to me and I passed it easily.</strong> </p>
<p><strong>This is an important exam for every middle school student. Every student wants to get a good mark in the exam. Practice makes perfect, only if we practise more we can get a good mark, or at least most of the students, teachers and parents think so. Before we do practise in the second semester of junior three ,of course we must finish all the subjects first. The other subjects is OK except chemistry, because we didn’t start to learn it until junior three. It is a little bit hard to finish all the contents in one semester, but we did it thanks to our own efforts and teachers’ efforts.</strong> </p>
<p><strong>During the revision and practise time , our teachers let us do an exam to let us establish which level we were at and find out our weakness . Then our teachers made a plan for everyone to tell us how we could enhance our strengths and improve our weakness. During the first quarter of the semester, our teachers told us to revise all the course work we had learned. After that nearly everyday we had tests of every subjects. We constantly practised and improved . Time flew, the exam arrived in the blink of an eye.Before the final exam ,we had done two mock exams,I didn’t do well in the two exams,so it made me very worried about my final exam. Then I went to ask my teachers how can Improve my mark and turn things around. She told me I just needed to change my attitude and not to put too many pressure on myself.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Before I started to do the exam I followed my teacher’s advice . Although I still felt a little bit nervous, the feeling was much better the in the in the two simulate exams.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The result came out after about two weeks when I was on the way to Mount Fuji. The result was as satisfying as the view there. I felt very happy and it meant it was worth all the efforts I had made over such a long time.</strong></p>
<p><strong>On the whole, it was the ending of the past and the beginning of new. I will keep working hard and achieve even more in the future.</strong></p>
